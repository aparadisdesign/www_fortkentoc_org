                Fort Kent is situated on the northern border of Maine in the Saint John River
                valley. The area is known for its ideal winter conditions with ample snow from
                December through April. Rolling hills, lakes, rivers, forests, farms are all
                scenes you experience as you drive over the hills into the valley.

              Moose, bears, white-tail deer, raccoons, and multiple species of birds are
              abundant. Nordic and alpine skiing, snowmobiling, ice fishing, and snowshoeing
              are all popular forms of winter recreation. In the summer, golfing, canoeing,
              fishing, boating, swimming, hiking, and biking occupy the residents' free time.
              Fort Kent and the St John Valley region have the small town atmosphere full of
              fun-loving, hard-working people who have embraced outdoor sports.
