              primarily for training skiers for Biathlon and recreation. With many thanks to
              uncountable volunteer hours, sponsorships from local businesses, various donations
              large and small, and continued support from Pineland Farms we have introduced many
              other ways for people near and far to embrace the outdoors such as Disc Golf, single
              track biking, extended snowshoe trails, Nature Series events, Jalbert Ski Program
              expansion, and many other enhancements to our marvelous gem in the St. John Valley.
              We are thankful for all donations, large and small! They help us continue to serve
              as a recreation hub for the Greater Fort Kent Area.
